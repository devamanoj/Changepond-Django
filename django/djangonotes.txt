What is a framework- it is a structure that you can build software on it

using framework saves time and reduces the risk of errors

you don't need to configured it (it creates a directory structure)

Libaries vs Framework
- library(Collection of pre - written code that can be used to perform common task)

user/programmer is calling the code

-> import math
-> math.sqrt(16)
-> 4.0

Framework:
in framework it is the code in the framework that calls the code
and framework tells you where you can put your code

as well

Why django?
Set up easy
Ready to user interface for administration activities

python package index(PyPi)

Python Package index(PyPi):
       -> Repository of software for the python programming language
       -> (helps you to find and install software developed and shared by python community)

working of django:
1.in pypi- virtualenvwrapper 1.2.7
2.unistall the old python version
3.install the python 3.9.10 version
4.we need to download the environment:
step:1 pip install virtualenvwrapper-in
step:2 mkvirtualenv envname
(template) C:\Users\admin\Desktop>pip freeze
asgiref==3.8.1
Django==4.2.15
sqlparse==0.5.1
typing_extensions==4.12.2
tzdata==2024.1
 
(template) C:\Users\admin\Desktop
step:3 pip install django
step:4 create a project - django-admin startproject schedule
step:5 change the directory: cd schedule
step:6 code .
step:7 run the code : py manage.py runserver
step:8 the project is created

django structure:
Django makes use of a directory structure to arrange different parts of the web application
>schedule
	schdedule --	__init__.py
				     	settings.py
				     	urls.py
				     	wsgi.py
					asgi.py
       manage.py
manage.py : 
->command-line utility for our project
->the file contains the code for running the server,makemigrations ... and several commands
->it lets you to interact with your project

settings.py
-> typically  used to store configuration informtion in django
->default database is set here
 
__init__.py 
->empty file , function of this file tells
python interpreter that is directory has package.
 
urls.py
-> used to provide you the address of the particular page
 
wsgi.py(web server gateway interface)
-> it is the way how servers interact with the applications
asgi.py(ASGI works similar to WSGI)

Step 1: mkvirtualenv envname
Step 2: install required packages
Step 3: pip freeze (check the packages )
Step 4: creating a project
Command : Django-admin startproject projectname
Step 5: py manage.py runserver
